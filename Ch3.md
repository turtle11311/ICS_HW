#### a.
```
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765
```

### b.
$F(20) = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^{20} - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^{20} = 6765.0$

### c.
I consider using definition algorithm is good, because formula in computer might
be issue in Floating-Point Precision.
In my computer using definition F(100) = 573147844013817084101, and formula F(100) = 3.54224848179e+20, not equals to 2 method

### 4.

#### a.
(1) 43 / 2 = 21...1
(2) 22 / 2 = 11
(3) 11 / 2 = 5...1
(4) 6 / 2 = 3
(5) 3 / 2 = 1...1
(6) 2 / 2 = 1

171 + 85 + 43 + 21 + 11 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 341

#### b.
At the end of the tournament, there is only one winner, 341 losers. Since each
match results in exactly one loser, the total number of matches is 341 for the
tournament.

#### c.
Both algorithms are clear and easy to understand, but the second algorithm is
more elegant and much efficient. Especially when the total number of players in
the tournament is large, there is a big difference in term of efficiency.
